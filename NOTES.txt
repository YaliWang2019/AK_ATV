Performance and Debugging Notes

2021-09-20: Chasing the inconsistent speed

The ATV drives different on different machines, and at different framerates. 

The biggest issue is the project settings (Edit -> Project Settings -> Time) had fixedDeltaTime hardcoded to 180fps, and Maximum Allowed Timestep the same value.  This meant physics entered slow motion if you were getting below 180Hz (!). 

WebGL seems to run fixedUpdate at 50Hz always. 

Another issue is the SteamVR SDK (included for VR but always active) was hardcoded in
SteamVR/Scripts/SteamVR_Render.cs to lock the fixedDeltaTime to the graphics framerate,
but only if it thinks VR is enabled. 

Fixes:
	- Set project fixedDeltaTime settings to 0.02 seconds, 50Hz, to work in WebGL.
	- Increase the project maximum allowed timestep to 0.1 seconds, so physics still works even if the framerate drops (e.g., ultra settings).
This seems to run consistently between 300fps (editor) and 30fps (ultra settings in WebGL). 
The ATV driving is a bit sticky, may need to re-tune steering (faster) and rollovers (easier).
